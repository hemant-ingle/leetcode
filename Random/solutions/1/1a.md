**Time Complexity:** *O(n),* **Space Complexity:** *O(n).*:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> lastSeen; /* Tracks the last index where each character was seen */
        int maxLength = 0, currentLength;
        for (int windowStart = 0, windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < s.size(); ++windowEnd)
        {
            char currentChar = s[windowEnd];
            if (lastSeen.find(currentChar) != lastSeen.end() && lastSeen[currentChar] >= windowStart) /*  If current character was seen and is within the current window */
            {
                windowStart = lastSeen[currentChar] + 1; /* Move the window start to exclude the repeated character */
            }
            currentLength = windowEnd - windowStart + 1;
            maxLength = max(maxLength, currentLength);
            lastSeen[currentChar] = windowEnd; /* Update the last seen index of the current character */
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

*Slight improvement: used `count()` instead of `find()` to check character presence in the map:*
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> lastSeen; /* Tracks the last index where each character was seen */
        int maxLength = 0, currentLength;
        for (int windowStart = 0, windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < s.size(); ++windowEnd)
        {
            char currentChar = s[windowEnd];
            if (lastSeen.count(currentChar) && lastSeen[currentChar] >= windowStart) /*  If current character was seen and is within the current window */
            {
                windowStart = lastSeen[currentChar] + 1; /* Move the window start to exclude the repeated character */
            }
            currentLength = windowEnd - windowStart + 1;
            maxLength = max(maxLength, currentLength);
            lastSeen[currentChar] = windowEnd; /* Update the last seen index of the current character */
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```
